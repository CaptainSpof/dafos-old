** How to install
*** Burning the ISO
First, we need to prepare the USB stick (do you remember future self, all the
hours wasted in this simple stuff?)

Two things to remember:
- Disk LabelType: ~GPT~
- Filesystem: FAT32

sudo dd if=/nix/store/<path from previous cmd>/iso/nixos.iso of=/dev/<usb dev> status=progress

** Acknowledgment
- This repository is based off the work of [[https://github.com/sweenu/nixfiles][sweenu]]
- My previous configuration was forked from [[https://github.com/hlissner/dotfiles][hlissner's dotfiles]] and many parts are still present here

** TODO
- [ ] cleanup ~i2c~ stuff (make a commit first to keep a trace)
*** Issues
- [ ] suspend break fn keys https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=216101
  fix in kernel 6.1?
- [ ] steam ui is small
  using GDK_SCALE = 2 fixes it
  but I am not sure how it will work with other app. Maybe I can wrap the variable in a derivation ?
- [X] plasma-integration not working
- [ ] custom keyboard layout isn't working
  - [ ] maybe wait for the ~kmonad~ module
  - [ ] while we're at it let's checkout this: https://bepo.fr/wiki/Utilisateur:Kaze/B%C3%A9po-intl
